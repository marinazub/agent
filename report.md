# Report on Children's Rights in the USA: Key Developments and Challenges (2024-2025)

This report provides an overview of significant developments and ongoing challenges impacting children's rights in the United States during the 2024-2025 period. Based on recent legislative actions, regulatory changes, policy discussions, and identified systemic issues, the landscape of children's rights continues to evolve, reflecting efforts to enhance protection, address emerging threats, and strengthen support systems.

## The Native American Child Protection Act (P.L. 118-160)

A landmark legislative achievement in late 2024 was the signing into law of the Native American Child Protection Act (Public Law 118-160) on December 23, 2024. This Act specifically targets the complex and often under-resourced area of child protection within Native American communities. Building upon existing frameworks like the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), which focuses on placement of Native children, P.L. 118-160 is designed to enhance the federal response to child abuse and neglect in Indian Country. It aims to improve coordination between federal, tribal, and state authorities, strengthen investigation and prosecution capabilities for crimes against children in tribal communities, and provide resources for prevention and intervention programs. The Act recognizes the unique jurisdictional challenges and historical trauma faced by Native communities and seeks to empower tribal governments in their efforts to protect their most vulnerable members. Its implementation in 2025 is expected to bring increased attention and resources to address the critical needs of Native American children facing maltreatment.

## FTC Finalizes COPPA Rule Changes

In January 2025, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced the finalization of significant changes to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Rule. These updates are a critical step in modernizing children's online privacy protections to align with current digital market dynamics and evolving business practices. The changes aim to strengthen safeguards around the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under 13. Key revisions focus on limiting companies' ability to monetize children's data, addressing emerging technologies and online environments (such as educational technology and connected toys), and clarifying the definition of "personal information." The updated rule seeks to reduce loopholes, enhance parental control, and hold online services and websites directed at children, or that knowingly collect information from children, more accountable. This move reflects growing concerns about the pervasive tracking and data collection practices in the digital space and their potential impact on children's development and privacy.

## State-Level Actions on Children's Online Privacy

Complementing federal efforts led by the FTC, numerous states are proactively legislating and implementing measures to shape the future of online privacy for children. Recognizing the limitations of federal law or seeking to provide stronger protections, states have introduced and passed their own privacy laws, often including specific provisions or separate acts focused on minors. These state-level initiatives frequently address issues such as the design of online services to protect children (e.g., defaulting to high privacy settings), limitations on targeted advertising to minors, requirements for data minimization, and provisions related to children's digital well-being. The patchwork of state laws creates a complex legal landscape for online platforms but underscores a broad consensus on the need for enhanced protections beyond the federal baseline. This active state involvement indicates a strong momentum towards establishing more robust privacy and safety standards for children in the digital realm.

## Ongoing Support for a Permanent Child Tax Credit

Discussion and support continue around making the expanded monthly Child Tax Credit (CTC), which was temporarily enhanced under the American Rescue Plan, permanent. Proposals like the American Family Act advocate for establishing a consistent, predictable monthly payment structure for the CTC, moving away from a single annual tax credit. Proponents argue that a permanent, fully refundable, and monthly CTC could significantly reduce child poverty rates, provide economic stability for families, and positively impact child well-being across various indicators, including health, education, and food security. While legislative consensus remains a challenge, the ongoing support highlights the recognition of the CTC as a powerful tool for direct financial assistance to families and a critical component of a comprehensive strategy to support children's rights to an adequate standard of living.

## Reports on U.S. Child Welfare System Reforms

A notable development in 2025 includes reports highlighting recent legal and policy shifts within the U.S. child welfare system in certain states. These reports detail the exploration and implementation of alternative models aimed at improving child protection while also addressing concerns related to family privacy and encouraging families to seek help proactively. Instead of focusing solely on investigation and removal, some jurisdictions are exploring approaches that emphasize prevention, early intervention, and providing voluntary support services to families before a crisis occurs. These models often involve community-based programs, differential response systems that tailor interventions to the level of risk, and efforts to reduce the stigma associated with seeking help from child protective services. These shifts reflect a growing understanding that strengthening families and respecting their privacy can be crucial components of an effective child protection strategy, potentially leading to better outcomes for children and families involved with the system.

## Bipartisan Improvements to Title IV-B Child Welfare Programs

Recent bipartisan child welfare legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives signals a commitment to strengthening federal support for state and local child welfare efforts. This legislation focuses on making improvements to Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, which provides funding for child welfare services, including prevention, family preservation, family support, and adoption assistance. A key aspect of the changes includes providing new resources specifically allocated for child welfare workforce recruitment and retention. Recognizing that a well-trained and stable workforce is essential for effective child protection and family support, this provision aims to address high turnover rates and staffing shortages that challenge many agencies. These legislative updates represent a collaborative effort to invest in the foundational elements of the child welfare system, aiming to improve service delivery and support for vulnerable children and families.

## Strategic Advocacy and Legal Action by Organizations

Organizations dedicated to children's rights, such as Children's Rights, continue their strategic advocacy and legal action efforts throughout 2025. These organizations play a crucial role in investigating, exposing, and challenging systemic violations of children's rights through litigation, policy advocacy, and public education. Their work often focuses on critically underperforming systems, including child welfare systems overburdened by caseloads and inadequate resources, and youth justice systems where children may face inappropriate detention, lack of access to necessary services, or violations of their due process rights. By filing lawsuits, negotiating settlement agreements, and monitoring compliance, these groups push for systemic reforms to ensure that states and localities meet their legal obligations to protect and care for children in their custody or under their supervision. Their ongoing efforts highlight persistent challenges and drive accountability for improving outcomes for vulnerable children.

## Enhanced Regulatory Frameworks for Children's Rights and Business

The year 2025 is being highlighted as a potential turning point regarding enhanced regulatory frameworks concerning children's rights and the responsibilities of businesses. There is increasing recognition that business activities across various sectors – from technology and entertainment to retail and manufacturing – can significantly impact children's rights, both positively and negatively. This includes impacts related to online safety and privacy, exposure to harmful content, ethical marketing practices, supply chain labor issues, and the design of products and services used by children. Discussions are focusing on the need for clearer standards, increased corporate accountability, and potentially new regulations that would require businesses to conduct due diligence on their impact on children's rights and implement measures to prevent harm. This evolving focus reflects a broader global movement towards integrating human rights, including children's rights, into business conduct standards.

## Addressing Climate Change as an Era-Defining Challenge

Climate change is widely recognized in 2025 as one of the most significant era-defining challenges affecting children's rights globally and within the USA. The impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events, environmental degradation, food and water insecurity, and increased displacement, disproportionately affect children, impacting their rights to health, survival, development, education, and protection. There is a growing call for policymakers, businesses, and communities to address climate change through a child-centered lens, considering the long-term consequences for future generations. Advocacy efforts emphasize the need for urgent climate action, investment in climate adaptation and resilience measures that protect children, and ensuring that children's perspectives are included in environmental decision-making processes. The scale of this challenge underscores the interconnectedness of environmental issues and the fulfillment of fundamental children's rights.

## Efforts to Incorporate Children's Perspectives

A positive trend observed and discussed in 2025 is the increased effort to better listen to children and incorporate their perspectives on issues affecting their lives. This involves moving beyond traditional consultation methods to actively create platforms and processes where children can safely share their views, experiences, and ideas on matters ranging from education and healthcare to online safety and environmental policy. Initiatives include youth advisory boards, participatory research projects involving children, and integrating child impact assessments into policy development. Recognizing children as rights-holders capable of forming and expressing their own views, in accordance with their evolving capacities, is a fundamental principle. These efforts aim to ensure that policies and programs designed for children are informed by their lived realities and that children have a voice in the decisions that shape their present and future.
